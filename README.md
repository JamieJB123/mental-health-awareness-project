**Author:** James Jarvis-Bicknell

**This project was developed as part of my 16-week full-stack development bootcamp with Code Institute. It brings together what we have learned from the front-end side of the course: HTML and CSS essentials + Bootstrap.**

## Design Choices:

### Colours: 

For my colour palette, I took inspiration from [pinterest](https://uk.pinterest.com/pin/823947694363170020/). For this website I wanted to evoke an inviting sense of warmth and calm as well as creating a playful, light-hearted and accessible feel. This selection tries to balance these two goals by using vibrant colours softened through pastel tones.

### Typography: 

The following fonts were selected from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) to further support the balance between calm / accessible and playful / light. Quicksand was chosen as the main typeface for its readability, accessibility and gentleness. Dynapuff was chosen for the major headings to inject a sense of playfulness into the site and balance out the potentially heavy subject-matter.

### Images and Icons:

Wherever icons were used in this project (resources section and footer), they were taken from [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/).

All images in this project were AI generated using [Microsoft Copilot](https://copilot.microsoft.com/chats/mpxbm6uP1PJA8vUpBgf1Y). This was used for several reasons: 
1. Avoid any possible copyright issues.
2. The colour palette was chosen before images. Therefore, using AI made it more straightforward to find images coherent with the colour scheme.
3. I did not want photorealistic images and feeding AI prompts enabled image-generation in keeping with the playful feel I was aiming for.

## Wireframes:

The basic structure of Healthy Mind was worked out using the wireframe software [BALSAMIQ](https://balsamiq.com/?gad_source=1&gad_campaignid=203404003&gbraid=0AAAAAD3BuzMO_b68z_FDD6MbtQx7bQ_6V&gclid=CjwKCAjwruXBBhArEiwACBRtHYXoWEdqjT_KJt9p8mXI8IdiipWikWrlgDIK9-gS3FKGd6jtQpN4qxoCpiQQAvD_BwE), to guide my development choices when coding. Over the project the vision for the layout changed and new sections were incorporated. An updated set of wireframes were created to reflect this. I have included both the original wireframes and the updated wireframes for comparison.
